"A1","Enhanced fracture toughness of hierarchical carbon nanotube reinforced carbon fibre epoxy composites with engineered matrix microstructure","Fibre reinforced hierarchical composites further reinforced with up to 25<U+202F>wt% of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were manufactured using a wet powder impregnation route. Microstructural heterogeneity in the matrix of these laminates was engineered during wet powder impregnation to produce CNTs rich regions with spatial separation. The Mode I fracture toughness of these heterogeneous hierarchical composites increased by 41% and 26% compared to that of baseline carbon fibre epoxy composites and hierarchical composites with homogeneously distributed CNTs throughout the matrix with similar CNT content, respectively. Increased crack path tortuosity was observed to contribute to this increase in fracture toughness. The interlaminar shear strength was unaffected by the matrix microstructural heterogeneity.","A.

"A2","Monitoring the drilling process of GFRP laminates with carbon nanotube buckypaper sensor","The present study presents an experimental investigation into the real-time monitoring of the drilling process of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composite with Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) buckypaper sensor. The spray-vacuum filtration method was employed to synthesize CNTs buckypaper sensor and then embedded into the GFRP to serve two purposes namely interlaminar enhancement and sensor monitoring the drilling process of the GFRP. Both modes I and II interlaminar fracture toughness tests were conducted to ascertain the enhancement ability of the buckypaper. Considerable improvements in both modes of fracture toughness were recorded in the specimens with CNTs buckypaper interlayer. For the CNTs buckypaper acting as a sensor, drilling experiments were carried out on the GFRP where real-time information of the drilling process particularly the drilling tool position could be predicted. This can be crucial in cases where drilling parameters like the feed rate have to be changed at a certain drilling depth in order to reduce or eliminate the exit delamination. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was finally employed to study the enhancement ability of the CNTs buckypaper and the microstructure of the drilled holes. The current work has substantiated the possibility of using CNT buckypaper both as an interlaminar enhancement and as a sensor to monitor the drilling process.","GFRP,Carbon nanotubes,Drill monitoring,Mechanical properties,Sensor","GongDong Wangac,NanLibc,StephenKirwa Mellya,TianPenga,Yingchi Lia,QiDi Zhaoa,ShuDe Jia","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822318320075"
"A3","Interlaminar properties of GFRP laminates toughened by CNTs buckypaper interlayer","The interlaminar property is essential to the application of fiber reinforced composites for the overall performance. For the purpose of enhancing the interlaminar properties, the unidirectional Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastics (GFRP) laminates were fabricated by adding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) buckypaper to the mid-plane layers under different curing pressures (1<U+202F>MPa, 2<U+202F>MPa, 3<U+202F>MPa). In order to study the enhancement mechanism of the CNTs buckypaper, a series of experiments were designed and conducted based on double cantilever beam (DCB), end notch flexure (ENF) and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests followed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination to study the surfaces of the specimens. It was observed that the modes I and II interlaminar fracture toughness of GFRP embedded with CNTs buckypaper were relatively higher than those without CNTs buckypaper. Considerable improvements in interlaminar shear strength of the laminates were obtained with the integration of the CNTs buckypaper between the interlayers. The micro-structure of the enhanced mixed interface of fiber-resin-CNTs responsible for interlaminar strengthening was further studied with the help of SEM. It was found that the higher curing pressure could increase the inter-diffusion of the resin and CNTs offering a stronger interfacial adhesion. The interlaminar characteristics of the specimens cured at 2<U+202F>MPa pressure were found to be relatively superior with optimal interlaminar fracture toughness and interlaminar shear strength.","Glass fibre reinforced plastics,Carbon nanotubes,Interlaminar fracture toughness,Interlaminar shear strength","NanLiab,Gong dongWangbc,Stephen KirwaMellybc,TianPengb,Ying ChiLib,QiDi Zhaob,Shude Jib","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2018.10.002","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026382231832333X"

"A5","The role of T-stress and stress triaxiality combined with the geometry on tensile fracture energy of brittle adhesives","In this study, a new semi-empirical evaluation method is proposed to take into account the effects of substrate stiffness and bondline thickness on the tensile fracture behavior of brittle adhesives. To this end, combined experimental-numerical analyses are conducted on double cantilever beams with various geometries. Two different data reduction approaches including the simple beam theory and the J-integral technique are employed to obtain the fracture energy of the tested joints. The experimental fracture energy and the corresponding numerical results are used to analyze the considered configurations based on the proposed relation. The new parameter is a function of the tensile fracture energy (GIC), the first non-singular stress term of William's series expansion (T-stress), the amount of stress triaxiality and the bondline thickness (t). Based on the proposed method, the role of each factor in the mode I fracture energy of brittle systems is specified. It is found that the T-stress has a critical impact on the GIC obtained by adhesively bonded double cantilever beams (DCBs) where the adhesive bondline is different. It is also shown that the effect of stress triaxiality is less significant but it should be taken into account. The results also show that the new relation can predict the effect of the substrate stiffness on the GIC of the considered adhesives very well. The optimum bondline thickness of DCBs corresponding to the maximum GIC is also predicted based on the proposed relation. Further validations are also performed by applying the method to experimental data previously published in the literature.","Brittle adhesives,Mode I fracture energy,T-stress,Stress triaxiality,DCB,Bondline thickness,Substrate stiffness","A.Akhavan-Safara,M.R.Ayatollahia,M.Moazzamia,L.F.M.da Silvab","International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2018.09.008","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143749618302124"

"A7","A modified DCB-UBM test method for interfacial fracture toughness characterization of sandwich composites","A novel double cantilever beam test method for interface fracture toughness characterization of debonded sandwich composites is introduced. The method is called DCB-UBM (Double Cantilever Beam loaded with Uneven Bending Moments), where pure moments are applied to the beams at the crack end using torsional actuators, to generate crack propagation along the face sheet/core interface. A data reduction method is proposed to determine the fracture toughness. Fracture testing is performed on a typical marine grade sandwich configuration consisting of PVC H45 foam core and glass fiber face sheets to demonstrate the applicability of the test method. The obtained fracture toughness agrees with interface toughness values in the literature measured using other test methods with the same material system. The effective kinematics of the test rig is measured using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) by studying the rotations and moments of a specially designed calibration specimen and comparing the results against finite element results. The DCB-UBM specimen and test method is a promising candidate for obtaining face sheet/core interface fracture toughnesses in sandwich composites.","DCB-UBM,Sandwich composite,Mode-mixity,CSDE,Face sheet/core interface","ChristianBerggreena,VishnuSaseendrana,Leif A.Carlssonb","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2018.06.036","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013794417313395"

"A10","Ply thickness dependence of the intralaminar fracture in thin-ply carbon-epoxy laminates","The effect of ply thickness t in intralaminar fracture of unidirectional thin-ply carbon-epoxy laminates is characterized by testing double cantilever beam (DCB) and compact tension (CT) specimens with different t. While the average intralaminar energy release rate (ERR) at initiation is found equal to the corresponding interlaminar values, the steady-state intralaminar ERRs, only reached in the DCB configuration, are approximately three times higher than the corresponding interlaminar values. Due to changes in the extent of bridging, intralaminar steady-state ERRs are ~30% higher in thick-ply (t<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.150<U+202F>mm) than in thin-ply laminates (t<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.030<U+202F>mm). Thin-ply composite laminates exhibit a faster ERR growth with crack length, and for DCB, reach steady-state at a much shorter crack extension than thick-ply composites. Traction profiles, due to bridging, are identified using R-curves and implemented in cohesive element simulations to predict intralaminar fracture of DCB and CT specimens. The experimental and simulated loaddisplacement responses are in good agreement.","A. Carbon fibers,B. Fracture toughness,C. Finite element analysis,D.

"A11","An improved delamination fatigue cohesive interface model for complex three-dimensional multi-interface cases","This work presents a cohesive interface model for predicting interlaminar failure of composite laminates under tension-tension fatigue loading. The model features improvements on previous formulations and utilizes four-integration-point elements, which offer several new advantages, while maintaining the merits of the previous single-integration-point elements. An element-based crack tip tracking algorithm is incorporated to confine fatigue damage to crack-tip elements only. A new local rate approach is proposed to ensure accurate integration of strain energy release rate from local elements. Furthermore, a dynamic fatigue characteristic length is proposed to offer a more accurate estimation of fatigue characteristic length in complex three-dimensional cases. Fatigue initiation is incorporated by using a strength reduction method, without changing the propagation characteristics. The numerical approach has been verified and validated using multiple cases and was then applied to fatigue damage development in open-hole laminates, where a good agreement between numerical analysis and experimental results was obtained.","A.

"A12","Effects of elevated loading rates on mode I fracture of composite laminates using a modified wedge-insert fracture method","In this paper, experimental results for rate dependence of interlaminar mode I fracture of a polymer matrix composite laminate are presented. A modified wedge-insert fracture (MWIF) method for conducting mode I fracture testing at elevated loading rates is used. A correction factor has been introduced to the modified beam theory method for measuring the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness using the MWIF method. The experimental method was successfully verified against the most widely used standardized method at quasi-static loading rates. Mode I interlaminar fracture testing was conducted at loading rates ranging from 0.01<U+202F>mm/s to 3600<U+202F>mm/s. A reduction in fracture toughness with rate was seen. The fracture behavior at elevated rates differed from the lower rates. The effect of bridging (and process zone) lengths on the fracture toughness were seen decreasing drastically with increased loading rate.","Mode I interlaminar fracture,Delamination,Wedge-insert fracture,Rate dependence,Elevated-rates","Solver I.Thorssona,Anthony M.Waasb,JosephSchaeferc,BrianJustussonc,SalvatoreLiguorec","Composites Science and Technology","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compscitech.2017.12.018","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026635381731182X"

"A15","Practical and theoretical considerations on the fracture toughness testing of dental restorative materials","BackgroundAn important tool in materials research, development and characterization regarding mechanical performance is the testing of fracture toughness. A high level of accuracy in executing this sort of test is necessary, with strict requirements given in extensive testing standard documents. Proficiency in quality specimen fabrication and test requires practice and a solid theoretical background, oftentimes overlooked in the dental community. Aims: In this review we go through some fundamentals of the fracture mechanics concepts that are relevant to the understanding of fracture toughness testing, and draw attention to critical aspects of practical nature that must be fulfilled for validity and accuracy in results. We describe our experience with some testing methodologies for CAD/CAM materials and discuss advantages and shortcomings of different tests in terms of errors in testing the applicability of the concept of fracture toughness as a single-value material-specific property.","Fracture toughness,Mechanical testing,Resin composite,Dental ceramic,Zirconia,R-curve","RenanBellia,MichaelWendlerab,José I.Zorzina,UlrichLohbauera","Dental Materials","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dental.2017.11.016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0109564117311727"
"A16","Phase field based peridynamics damage model for delamination of composite structures","We extend and exploit a phase field based peridynamics (PD) damage model ([39]) for studying delamination of composite structures. Utilizing a phase field augmented PD framework, our idea is to model the interfacial cohesive damage through degradation functions and the fracture or fragmentation through the critical energy release rate. Our model eliminates the conventional traction-separation law (TSL) that is known to result in the popular cohesive zone model (CZM). In the process, the approach potentially addresses some limitations of the existing techniques, for example, CZM, virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and so on, which make use of an empirical interaction among different modes of loading (e.g., mode I, mode II etc.). By regarding delamination under different loading conditions as problems that differ only in their boundary conditions, our approach provides for a more general scheme for tracking delamination growth. Our proposal thus accords no special treatment to the different modes and can handle general spatial locations of weaker interface layers. With no special crack tracking algorithms or additional ad-hoc criteria for crack propagation, considerable computational simplicity also accrues. The approach admits an easy extension to cases where cracks can propagate even in the bulk material body. The new bond breaking criterion that we employ replaces the ad-hoc approach inherent in bond-stretch-based or bond-energy-based conditions. Unlike standard phase field models, physical fragmentation of the body is feasible in the present model. The proposed methodology also eliminates the problem of matter interpenetration by its very construction. Apart from an initial validation exercise for a laminated composite plate with a hole where no or little damage occurs, we also use numerical simulations on mode I, mode II, and mixed mode delamination cases in order to assess the performance of our model by benchmarking it against available experimental evidence. Simulations on modified mixed mode bending and multiple layer delamination are also presented.","Phase field,Peridynamics,Delamination,Mixed mode,Multiple-layer delamination","PraneshRoya,S.P.Deepua,AnilPathrikara,DebasishRoya,J.N.Reddyb","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2017.08.071","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026382231731601X"
"A17","Validation of pure tensile and shear cohesive laws obtained by the direct method with single-lap joints","Joining with structural adhesives in the aeronautical industry dates back to some decades, although only more recently this technique has been implemented to load bearing parts in other industries. This technique enables joining steel with aluminium or fibre-reinforced composites, with a major weight advantage. Cohesive Zone Models (CZM) are an accurate design method for bonded structures but, depending on the adhesive type and specimen's geometry, the accuracy of the strength predictions may be highly compromised by the choice of the cohesive laws. This work presents a validation of tensile and shear CZM laws of three adhesives obtained by the direct method applied to Double-Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End-Notched Flexure (ENF) tests, respectively. The validation is carried out by considering a mixed-mode bonded geometry (the single-lap joint) with different overlap lengths (LO) and adhesives of distinct ductility. Initially, the precise shape of the cohesive law in tension and shear of the adhesives is estimated, followed by their simplification to parameterized triangular, trapezoidal and linear-exponential CZM laws. Validation of the CZM laws was accomplished by direct comparison of the load-displacement (P-d) curves and maximum load (Pm) of the single-lap joints as a function of the tested LO values. The strength predictions were accurate for a CZM law shape consistent with the adhesive type, although the differences between CZM shapes were not too significant.","A. Epoxides,A. Polyurethanes,B.

"A18","A fatigue crack propagation model with resistance curve effects for an epoxy/copper interface","Fatigue crack propagation for copper/epoxy molding compound interfaces is modeled in this work by conducting cyclic loading on double cantilever beam test specimens. The continued increase in mechanical compliance of test specimens as the crack propagates through hundreds of cycles is used to determine the crack length and thus, the crack growth rate per cycle which is used to determine the Paris law constants as a function of strain energy release rate range. When monotonic debonding testing is conducted, it is seen that the critical strain energy release rate initially increases with the crack length and then stabilizes demonstrating the increasing resistance for the epoxy/copper interface. When such an increasing R-curve is used to normalize the strain energy release rate range, it is observed that the Paris law constants can be determined with good consistency for a wide range of specimens over different crack lengths.","Double cantilever beam,Fatigue crack growth,Interface fracture,Compliance method,R-curves","DavidSamet,V.N.N.Trilochan Rambhatla,AbhishekKwatra,Suresh K.Sitaraman","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2017.05.008","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013794417300565"

"A20","Effect of structural dynamic characteristics on fatigue and damage tolerance of aerospace grade composite materials","In aircraft structural integrity analysis, the damage tolerance and fatigue life is investigated against a cyclic loading spectrum. The particular spectrum includes the stress/loading levels counted during a flight of certain duration. The occurrences of load factors may include higher gravitational acceleration g levels. While maintaining a certain g level occurrence at higher angle of attack, wing structure vibrates with the amplitudes of its natural frequencies. The cyclic stress amplitudes of vibration depend upon the natural frequencies of vibrating structure, i.e. lower frequency gives higher amplitudes and vice versa.To improve the dynamic stability, modal parameters of simple carbon fibre sandwich panels have been adjusted by tailoring the fibre orientation angles and stacking sequence. In this way, the effect of change in structural dynamic characteristics on fatigue life of this simplified structure has been demonstrated. The research methodology followed in this work consists of two phases. In the first phase, aero-elastically tailored design was finalized using FEM based modal analysis and unsteady aerodynamic analysis simulations followed by experimental modal analysis. In the second phase, fatigue and damage tolerance behaviour of material was investigated using different fracture mechanics based techniques. ASTM's standard practices were adopted to determine material allowable and fracture properties. Simulation work was performed after proper calibration and correlation of finite element model with experimentally determined static and dynamic behaviour of panels.It has been observed that the applicable cyclic loading spectra, as major input parameter of fatigue analysis, largely depend upon the natural frequencies, damping and the stiffness of the structure. The results and discussions of the whole exercise may be beneficial while carrying out aero-elastic tailoring of composite aircraft wing. This research work has also a positive contribution towards multidisciplinary structural design optimization of aerospace vehicles.","Structural dynamics,Composite materials,Fatigue analysis,Multidisciplinary design optimization","WaqasAnwar,M.Zubair Khan,AsifIsrar,ShahidMehmood,Nazeer A.Anjum","Aerospace Science and Technology","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ast.2017.01.012","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963816307738"

The existing methodologies for mode II fatigue testing using three-point bending end-notched flexure (3-ENF) under constant cyclic displacement conditions yield discontinuous delamination growth rate curves, therefore requiring a batch of several specimens to be tested under different severity conditions in order to fully characterize the crack growth.

In this paper, the initiation and propagation of delamination in laminated composite materials are investigated by performing Double Cantilever Beams (DCBs) tests. Acoustic Emissions (AEs) are used to characterize the delamination crack tip during DCB tests. For this purpose, a combination of AE signal localizations and scattering reduction procedure is implemented to determine the delamination tip position. Besides, bi-linear and tri-linear Cohesive Zone Models (CZMs) are implemented to investigate the initiation and propagation of delamination. The results show that the tri-linear CZM can accurately determine both the initiation and propagation of delamination in the existence of fiber bridging while bi-linear CZM fails to do so. It is also found that AE is a powerful approach in determining the position of the delamination crack tip.","Delamination,Acoustic Emission,Cohesive Zone Modeling,Laminated composite","MiladSaeedifara,MehdiAhmadi Najafabadia,JalalYousefiab,RezaMohammadia,HosseinHosseini Toudeshkyc,GiangiacomoMinakb","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.11.020","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822316312661"

The cohesive zone approach along with the level set method is used to simulate fatigue-driven delamination growth. The cohesive zone method is used for calculation of the energy release rate at the crack front because of its superiority over the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) for bi-material interfaces and non self-similar crack growth. Evolution of the crack front in 3D during fatigue growth is handled with the level set method. The damage variable in the cohesive zone formulation is changed according to the updated level set field.

"A29","4: Wrought Aluminium Alloys","Approximately 70% of aluminum produced globally is cast and fabricated into wrought alloy products by processes that are briefly described. These alloys are divided into two groups depending on whether or not they respond to heat treatment. The mechanical properties of the non-heat-treatable alloys are controlled by work hardening and annealing, whereas the heat-treatable groups are strengthened by age hardening. Temper designations are listed and described. Compositions and tensile properties of many of the commercial alloys are summarized in tables and their individual characteristics are discussed in some detail. Joining processes involving arc welding, friction stir welding, laser welding, brazing, diffusion bonding, and soldering are described. Attention is then directed to the commercial applications of the wrought aluminum alloys in the aerospace, automotive, shipping, packaging, and building industries. Reference is also made to lighter weight lithium-containing alloys that are finding structural applications in modern aircraft. Other more specialized topics include powder metallurgy products, aluminum alloy bearings, superplastic alloys, and aluminum-ion storage batteries.","Alloy compositions,work hardening,precipitation,age hardening,temper designations,thermomechanical processing,mechanical properties,joining,commercial applications,specialized products","IanPolmear,DavidStJohn,Jian-FengNie,MaQian","Light Alloys,Light Alloys (Fifth Edition)","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-099431-4.00004-X","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008099431400004X"

An FE model based on the use of progressive damage schemes for modelling intralaminar and interlaminar damage and accounting for the bridging action of stitching threads was developed in the study. Individual stitches were modelled by solid elements inserted along the thickness of the laminate and connected to the adjacent layer elements through cohesive interface elements. The predictions of the model were assessed by comparison with experimental data obtained by drop-weight impact tests on [03/903]S and [0/90]3S carbon/epoxy laminates. The numerical results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations in terms of force histories, force-deflection curves and internal damage induced by impact. In particular, the proposed model was able to correctly predict the effect of stitching on the damage response of the laminates at different impact energies and to capture the influence of the layup on the efficiency of stitching for improving the delamination resistance of the laminated samples.","Impact,Composite laminates,Stitching,Damage,Finite Element analysis","L.Francesconi,F.Aymerich","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2016.09.050","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822316311515"

In this paper, an experimental investigation of the influence of different fatigue parameters (mean opening/sliding displacement, amplitude, frequency, number of cycles) on the through-thickness reinforcement (TTR) is presented. For mode I, it is shown that the degradation on pin behaviour during fatigue is mostly affected by the applied displacement amplitude. The degradation is primarily caused by surface wear. Due to the brittleness of the Z-pins, mode II fatigue does not have a significant effect for very small sliding displacements. Exceeding a critical displacement causes the pin to rupture within the very first cycles.","A. 3-Dimensional reinforcement,B. Wear,C. Fatigue,D.

In the VCCTXLWM method, the laminated composite plates and shells with delamination and transverse crack are simulated by the XLWM method, and the strain energy release rate (SERR) along the delamination front is calculated by the VCCT.

"A34","A novel method for fatigue delamination simulation in composite laminates","This paper presents a FEM model for the simulation of delamination in composite materials under fatigue loads using extended cohesive interface elements. A virtual fatigue damage variable is proposed to continually locate the crack tip elements with local element information only. The proposed method allows for a fully automatic identification of crack tip elements without any global information. Once crack tip elements are identified, the fatigue damage accumulation is determined by a modified Paris-law with a strain energy release rate correction method to reduce mesh sensitivity. The predicted delamination growth rates of different mesh sizes were compared with experimental results from open literature using a mode-I Double Cantilever Beam specimen and a mode-II 4-point End Notch Flexure specimen respectively. In all cases good agreement was obtained with weak mesh dependency.","Fatigue,Delamination,FEM,Mesh sensitivity","ChongcongTao,JinhaoQiu,WeixingYao,HongliJi","Composites Science and Technology","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compscitech.2016.03.016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026635381630104X"
"A35","XFEM simulation of delamination in composite laminates","In this paper, the extended finite element method (XFEM) is extended to simulate delamination problems in composite laminates. A crack-leading model is proposed and implemented in the ABAQUS® to discriminate different delamination morphologies, i.e., the 0°/0° interface in unidirectional laminates and the 0°/90° interface in multidirectional laminates, which accounts for both interlaminar and intralaminar crack propagation. Three typical delamination problems were simulated and verified. The results of single delamination in unidirectional laminates under pure mode I, mode II, and mixed mode I/II correspond well with the analytical solutions. The results of multiple delaminations in unidirectional laminates are in good agreement with experimental data. Finally, using a recently proposed test that characterizes the interaction of delamination and matrix cracks in cross-ply laminates, the present numerical results of the delamination migration caused by the coupled failure mechanisms are consistent with experimental observations.","B.

Low-modulus rubbery adhesives are attracting rising interest as an alternative to conventional rigid structural adhesives due to benefits such as the excellent impact resistance they provide. This paper is the first of two parts that investigate, both experimentally and numerically, the mechanical behaviour of a rubbery adhesive and the bonded joints to be used in a lightweight automobile structure. This part 1 paper characterises the fracture behaviour of the flexible adhesive layer with thick bondlines and presents a way to reliably determine the fracture mechanics parameters under a range of loading modes. Assessment of the various fracture tests indicated that DCB and SLB should provide mode I and mixed mode fracture energies but that the conventional ENF for mode II would not be practical for such compliant adhesive layers. Instead a cracked thick adherend shear specimen was developed and used. Reliable fracture energies were obtained from these specimens and a mixed mode fracture criterion developed for application in the part 2 paper.","Polyurethane,Fracture toughness,Steels,Resin based composites,Mixed mode","K.Hasegawaa,A.D.Crocombea,F.Coppuckb,D.Jewelb,S.Maherb","International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2015.09.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143749615001396"
"A40","An experimental investigation of interlaminar and intralaminar dynamic fracture of CFRPs: Effect of matrix modification using carbon nanotubes","In this work, mode-I dynamic interlaminar and intralaminar fracture behaviors of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are studied. Thick unidirectional composites were fabricated and their fracture performance was characterized under quasi-static three-point bending and dynamic one-point impact loading conditions. Both crack initiation and growth characteristics under stress-wave dominant conditions were evaluated in the latter case. The optical methods of digital image correlation (DIC) and ultra-high speed photography were employed to monitor crack tip deformations around transiently growing cracks. All relevant elastic properties were measured ultrasonically in order to determine stress intensity factors (SIFs). Interlaminar fracture responses were compared to the intralaminar counterparts using specimens of identical dimensions from the same original composite plate. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were then added with the aim of improving interlaminar fracture properties. While CNTs did not lead to improvements in critical stress intensity factor (KIC/KI-inid), they did lead to modest improvements in fracture toughness (GIC/GI-inid) under both quasi-static (+34%) and dynamic (+16%) loading conditions with significant scatter observed in these measurements.","Dynamic fracture,Inter-/Intra-laminar fracture,Carbon fiber reinforced composites,Digital image correlation,Carbon nanotubes,Ultrasonic measurements","Robert W.Bedsolea,Philip B.Bogertb,Hareesh V.Tippura","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.07.016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822315005589"

The effect of the interlaminar thermoplastic veils on the Mode-I strain energy release rate (GIC), flexural stiffness, glass transition temperature (Tg) and water absorption behaviour was determined using two commercially available Benzoxazine resins. Despite an increase in the maximum moisture content, the veils greatly enhanced GIC by an increase in fibre bridging of PA fibres, with concurrent reductions in flexural stiffness. Water ingress resulted in large reductions in the Tg, although no significant change was observed due to the PA interlayers. Fibre bridging and fibre pull-out were the main mechanisms by which the veils assisted in resisting delamination. The presence of the water was observed to degrade mechanical properties due to a reduction in fibre/matrix interfacial strength, molecular degradation and plasticisation of the matrix.","A.

"A42","3: Testing, Experiments and Properties of HSREP","Normal-incidence and pressure-shear plate impact experiments have been conducted to study the mechanical response of an elastomer, polyurea P-1000, at high strain rates  105106 s-1  and high pressures  up to 18 GPa. Configurations with samples sandwiched between two hard plates have been used to conduct constant-pressure, pressure-change, and low-pressure experiments to investigate the pressure dependence of the shearing resistance. A symmetric pressure-shear plate impact configuration has been used to measure directly the thickness-averaged nominal strain rates of the sample  as well as the tractions on both of its interfaces with linear elastic plates. Release wave experiments have been used to capture the behavior at compressive stresses below 0.5 GPa, and still lower until tensile failure occurs. From these experiments, the quasi-isentrope of polyurea is obtained as well as its high-strain-rate shearing resistance at pressures up to 18 GPa. The experimental results show that the shearing resistance of polyurea increases strongly  essentially proportionally  with increasing pressure.Based on these experimental results, a quasi-linear viscoelasticity model is introduced to capture the observed nonlinear pressure-volume behavior, the strong dependence of shearing resistance on pressure, and the strong relaxation of deviatoric stresses. This model has been implemented in Abaqus to simulate the response of polyurea P-1000 under the impact conditions of the various experiments. Results of these simulations are compared with the experimental results to gain understanding of the viability of the proposed model. Finally, an assessment is made of current understanding of the mechanical response of polyurea P-1000 and what further high-strain-rate and high-pressure research is required.Certain elastomers, when present on the front (strike-face) side of steel, significantly enhance the resistance to ballistic penetration. The mechanism is primarily twofold: (1) impact induces a viscoelastic phase transition in the polymer, with consequent large energy absorption; and (2) the transient hardening of the rubber (by approximately. three orders of magnitude) spreads the impact force laterally, reducing the local pressure. The result is armor having improvements in ballistic performance of approximately 50% without additional weight (or substantial reductions in areal density without loss of penetration resistance). Variations on this approach, using multiple rubber or steel layers, or replacing the elastomer coating with a laminate composed of thin elastomer and metal layers, are described.The question of the range of applicability of the timetemperature superposition principle or of timetemperature equivalence has often been questioned. Specifically, the assurance that the extrapolation of data acquired at strain rates and time scales appropriate for quasistatic deformations may be appropriate under conditions involving very high rate or extremely short time scales has not been guaranteed in the past. Evidence is presented here showing that the use of data derived from quasistatic deformation histories is applicable to time scales that are shorter by factors of 106108 which cover most of the deformation rates germane to explosive environments.","elastomer,polyurea,high strain rate,high pressure,pressure-shear,plate impact,quasi-linear viscoelasticity,elastomers,polyurea (PU),fragment simulating projectiles,coating,ballistics,viscoelasticity,polymer time response,explosive viscoelasticity,timetemperature superposition principle,timetemperature equivalence,quasistatic vs high rate viscoelasticity","","Elastomeric Polymers with High Rate Sensitivity,Elastomeric Polymers with High Rate Sensitivity","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-35400-4.00003-9","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323354004000039"

"A45","9: Mesh-independent matrix cracking and delamination modeling in advanced composite materials","Rapid increases in the utilization of composite materials in aviation and other lightweight applications has revitalized interest in manufacturing, performance, and cost characteristics of these materials. The cost associated with such advanced structures, however, is determined less by the cost of the materials than by design and qualification expense. Detailed modeling of deformation and fracture of composite materials is widely considered a critical step towards a new design and qualification paradigm where significant amount of testing will be replaced by computational simulation. The complexity of the problem lies in the interaction of various modes of damage such as matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber failure, which cooperatively lead to a loss of load-carrying capacity and/or loss of integrity.A regularized extended finite element method (Rx-FEM) has been developed and implemented, allowing the modeling of complex interactive networks of matrix cracks and delaminations in a discrete damage modeling (DDM) framework. The regularized formulation preserves the element Gauss integration schema for arbitrary cracking direction and allows straightforward connections between neighboring plies with different orientations of properties and cracks. A cohesive zone method is used in conjunction with Rx-FEM to predict the damage associated with matrix cracking and delamination evolution. Ply level stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness properties measured in independent experiments are the only properties required for analysis.The DDM methodology appears to be well suited to a large number of complicated damage evolution problems in composite materials. It has been applied to unidirectional lamina, multidirectional laminates, notched laminates, and now textile composites. Experimental efforts to validate textile simulation results are currently underway. The DDM methodology is being extended to include other important aspects of damage simulation in composite materials. These include addressing fatigue damage evolution, microscale geometric specimens, realistic stochastic considerations, and thermal-oxidative damage growth. The DDM framework presented herein provides a predictive tool for modeling complex composite material damage evolution.","Composites laminates,Progressive failure,Rx-FEM,Phantom nodes,Textile composites","E.V.Iarve*,D.H.Mollenhauer","Numerical Modelling of Failure in Advanced Composite Materials,Numerical Modelling of Failure in Advanced Composite Materials","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-100332-9.00009-8","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780081003329000098"

Multi-walled carbon-nanotubes (MWCNTs) are grown perpendicular to and on the surface of a woven carbonfiber fabric using a chemical vapor deposition process. An increase in sensitivity of resistance change under interlaminar fracture is shown through a series of double cantilever beam (DCB) tests on samples prepared with MWCNTs grown on both sides of carbonfiber fabric lamina placed at the top and bottom surfaces of an 8-layer test panel whereas samples with MWCNTs inside the samples did not show much increase in sensitivity of resistance change compared with the baseline samples without MWCNTs. The results suggest that the addition of surface positioned hierarchical carbon-nanotube lamina on composite structures has the potential for autonomic sensing of internal matrix damage.","A.

"A49","An XFEM-based methodology for fatigue delamination and permeability of composites","A methodology for the simulation of thermal fatigue delamination in composites and prediction of delaminated crack opening displacement (DCOD) and composite laminate permeability is presented. This is critical for the safe design of composite cryogenic fuel tanks. The methodology, which is based on an extended finite element method for simulation of crack growth, does not require a priori definition of initial crack (delamination) length or crack propagation path. In contrast, previous work required estimation of delamination length and corresponding number of thermal cycles based on experimental measurements. The methodology is validated against measurements from standardised static and fatigue delamination test methods. Prediction of delamination crack growth in a quasi-isotropic laminate under cryogenic fatigue loading is used to establish the effect of initial interlaminar defect length on subsequent crack growth, as well as the effect of delamination length on DCOD and permeability. A key additional benefit is that the proposed method can simulate both inter- and intralaminar crack growth in two- and three-dimensional geometries.","Polymermatrix composites,Carbon fibres,Fatigue,Delamination,Finite element analysis (XFEM)","D.M.Grogan,S.B.Leen,C.M.Ó Brádaigh","Composite Structures","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.07.050","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822313003887"

"A57","A review of finite element analysis of adhesively bonded joints","The need to design lightweight structures and the increased use of lightweight materials in industrial fields, have led to wide use of adhesive bonding. Recent work relating to finite element analysis of adhesively bonded joints is reviewed in this paper, in terms of static loading analysis, environmental behaviors, fatigue loading analysis and dynamic characteristics of the adhesively bonded joints. It is concluded that the finite element analysis of adhesively bonded joints will help future applications of adhesive bonding by allowing system parameters to be selected to give as large a process window as possible for successful joint manufacture. This will allow many different designs to be simulated in order to perform a selection of different designs before testing, which would currently take too long to perform or be prohibitively expensive in practice.","Adhesive bonding,Joint design,Finite element stress analysis,Fracture mechanics,Dynamic mechanical analysis","XiaocongHe","International Journal of Adhesion and Adhesives","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2011.01.006","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143749611000169"

Development of the law is based on a detailed study of the numerical cohesive zone and the extraction of strain energy release rate from this zone, enabling a direct link with experimental Paris Law data. The law is implemented using three-dimensional interface elements within the explicit finite element code LS-Dyna. Validation is presented by way of application to composite material fatigue fracture toughness tests; Double Cantilever Beam for Mode I, End Notch Flexure for mode II and Mixed Mode Bending for the mixed mode case.

"A65","Effect of Z-pins' diameter, spacing and overlap length on connecting performance of CMC single lap joint","The effect of through-thickness reinforcement by composite pins (Z-pins) on the static tensile strength and failure mechanisms of the joints made from ceramic matrix composite (CMC) is investigated. Overlap length of the single lap joint is 15 mm, 20 mm, 23 mm, 37 mm, and 60 mm, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the final failure modes of the joints can be divided into two groups, (a) the bond-line stops debonding until crack encounters Z-pins; and then the adherends break at the location of Z-pins, when overlap length is more than 20 mm; (b) the bond-line detaches entirely and Z-pins are drawn from adherends, when overlap length is equal to 15 mm. A simple efficient computational approach is presented for analyzing the benefit of through-thickness pins for restricting failure in the single lap joints. Here, the mechanics problem is simplified by representing the effect of the pins by tractions acting on the fracture surfaces of the cracked bond-line. The tractions are prescribed as functions of the crack displacement, which are available in simple forms that summarize the complex deformations to a reasonable accuracy. The resulting model can be used to track the evolution of complete failure mechanisms, for example, bond-line initial delamination and ultimate failure associated with Z-pin pullout, ultimate failure of the adherends. The paper simulates connecting performance of the single lap joints with different Z-pins' diameter, spacing and overlap length; the numerical results agree with the experimental results; the numerical results indicate enlarging diameter and decreasing spacing of Z-pins are in favor of improving the connecting performance of the joints. By numerical analysis method, the critical overlap length that lies between two final failure modes is between 18 mm and 19 mm, when Z-pins' diameter and spacing are 0.4 mm, 5 mm, respectively.","ceramic matrix composite (CMC),single lap joint,Z-pins,connecting performance,overlap length,diameter,spacing","YongqiangTao,GuiqiongJiao,BoWang,YanjunChang","Acta Mechanica Solida Sinica","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10338-008-0856-8","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089491660960224X"

"A68","Cohesive modeling of delamination in Z-pin reinforced composite laminates","The mode I interlaminar fracture in Z-pin reinforced composite laminates is modeled using a cohesive volumetric finite element (CVFE) scheme. The test configuration used in this study is a Z-pin reinforced double cantilever beam specimen. A bilinear rate-independent but damage-dependent cohesive tractionseparation law is adopted to model the fracture of the unreinforced composite and discrete nonlinear spring elements to represent the effect of the Z-pins. The delamination toughness and failure strength of the Z-pin reinforced composites are determined by a detailed comparison study of the numerical modeling results with experimental data. To further reduce the computational effort, we introduce an equivalent distributed cohesive model as a substitute for the discrete nonlinear spring representation of the Z-pins. The cohesive model is implemented on various test problems with varying failure parameters and for varying spatial Z-pin reinforcement configurations showing good agreement with the experimental results.","Z-pin,Cohesive modeling,Fracture toughness,CVFE scheme,Mode I failure,Double cantilever beam,C.

"A70","Cohesive fracture modeling of crack growth in thick-section composites","This paper presents a combined method for modeling the mode-I and II crack growth behavior in thick-section fiber reinforced polymeric composites having a nonlinear material response. The experimental part of this study includes crack growth tests of a thick composite material system manufactured using the pultrusion process. It consists of alternating layers of E-glass unidirectional roving and continuous filament mats in a polymeric matrix. Integrated micromechanical and cohesive finite element (FE) models are used to simulate the crack growth response in eccentrically loaded single-edge-notch, (tension), ESE(T) and notched butterfly specimens. Micromechanical constitutive models for the mat and the roving layers are used to generate the effective nonlinear material behavior from the in situ fiber and matrix responses. The validity of the numerical modeling approach before the onset of crack growth is investigated using an infrared thermal method. Cohesive FE models are calibrated and used to simulate the complete crack growth behavior for different crack configurations. The proposed integrated framework of multi-scale material models with cohesive fracture models is shown to be an effective method for predicting the structural and material responses including failure load and crack growth in thick-section fiber reinforced polymeric composites.","","RamiHaj-Alia,RaniEl-Hajjarb,AnastasiaMulianac","Engineering Fracture Mechanics","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2006.04.003","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001379440600124X"

"A77","Crack initiation and growth during low-cycle fatigue of discontinuously reinforced metal-matrix composites","The initiation and growth of surface cracks during low-cycle fatigue of an AA6061 alloy composite containing (a) 15 vol% of SiC particles and (b) 20 vol% of Saffil short fibres were studied. For both of the composites, cracks are initiated very early in the fatigue life irrespective of the cyclic strain amplitude. A full three-dimensional FEM simulation demonstrated that the inhomogeneous distributions of stresses and strains induced by the particles and fibres are enhanced at a free surface relative to the interior of the material. This promotes surface crack initiation either by cracking of the reinforcement or near interfacial cracking in the matrix. The growth rates of the surface microcracks are an order of magnitude faster than the growth rates of long through-cracks at corresponding values of the crack growth parameter <U+0394>J. It was further observed that surface cracks shorter than 100 µm grow at a decelerating rate, yet did not show any threshold behaviour. Despite this early initiation of microcracks in the composites, the particulate composite notably showed a larger tolerance against plastic strain cycling than the unreinforced matrix in the lower range of cyclic plastic strain amplitudes.","metal-matrix composites,Al alloy,short fibres,particles,low-cycle fatigue,microcracks,crack initiation,crack growth","M.Levin,B.Karlsson","International Journal of Fatigue","https://doi.org/10.1016/0142-1123(93)90483-7","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0142112393904837"

"A81","Chapter 4: Experimental Characterization of Delamination Fracture","Experimental methods for characterizing interlaminar fracture behavior of composite materials are discussed. The classic short-beam shear test is presented along with a number of methods based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. These methods include the double cantilever beam test, the edge-delamination test, the end-notch flexure test, both the single and double cracked-lap shear test, and the off-axis center notch tensile test. Each test method is discussed from an applied mechanics point-of-view. Such an approach is appropriate in light of the complex nature of composite materials. In addition, relationships between fundamental experimental data and structural performance are considered. This includes consideration of mixed-mode failure criteria and a parametric study involving a one-dimensional delamination buckling model for evaluating the materials characterization/structural performance interface. Consideration is also given to relationships between basic resin properties and in situ performance as a matrix material in the composite.","","James M.WHITNEY","Composite Materials Series","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-87285-2.50008-X","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978044487285250008X"
